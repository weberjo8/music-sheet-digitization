# music-sheet-digitization
This "Jugend Forscht" project aims to write a Python code to digitize music sheets into playable audio files.

The key steps are 
1) digitization of a paper sheet of a score to an image file through Python libraries that control the camera
2) definition of all relevant parameters defining a music score and capsulation into "score" and "note" objects,
3) identification of the score, its staves and the individual notes in the digital image through AI (neural network),
4) identification of metadata,
5) storage as a playable audio file containing all relevant information from the music sheet.

If these steps can be carried out successfully, a reverse algorithm that produces printable music sheets from an audio file would be an exciting extension leading to a democratization of music. 

At present, the list of project developers includes as project students
Hannes Reuter
and as a senior mentor
Johannes H. Weber.
